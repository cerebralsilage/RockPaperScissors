# Rock, Papaer, Scissors

Built a simple rock, paper, scissors; JavaScript game. I plan to upgrade it in the next version with some css/js automated hands, and a promise function that displays the answer as the hands throw the signs.  Feedback always appreciated.  Go ahead and enter a choice and hit play.  

PS... There a cheat word that beats everything.  Have fun!
